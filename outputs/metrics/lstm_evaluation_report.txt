  TURING MACHINE CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS: LSTM
======================================================================

 **MEMORY CHARACTERISTICS**
  • Type: STATEFUL with LONG-TERM MEMORY (Cell state + Hidden state)
  • Comparison to Turing Machine:
    - LSTM has CELL STATE (analogous to TM's tape)
    - GATES control information flow (like TM's transition function)
    - Can selectively remember/forget information
  • Implications:
    - Handles LONG-TERM dependencies effectively
    - Mitigates vanishing gradient problem
    - More sophisticated memory management than RNN

 **SEQUENCE PROCESSING**
  • Processing Model: SEQUENTIAL with GATED MEMORY
  • Comparison to Turing Machine:
    - Similar sequential processing to TM
    - Forget gate: decides what to remove from memory
    - Input gate: decides what new information to store
    - Output gate: decides what to output
  • Implications:
    - Excellent for long sequences
    - Can learn complex temporal patterns
    - More parameters = more computational cost

  **COMPUTABILITY & EXPRESSIVENESS**
  • Computational Power:
    - LSTMs are TURING-COMPLETE (theoretically)
    - More practical than vanilla RNNs for complex tasks
    - Can approximate any sequential function
  • Advantages over RNN:
    - Better gradient flow (no vanishing gradient)
    - Can learn dependencies across 100+ time steps
    - More stable training
