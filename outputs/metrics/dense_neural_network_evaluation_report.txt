  TURING MACHINE CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS: DENSE
======================================================================

 **MEMORY CHARACTERISTICS**
  • Type: STATELESS (No memory between inputs)
  • Comparison to Turing Machine:
    - A Turing Machine has a TAPE for memory storage
    - Dense NN has NO sequential memory - each input is independent
    - Similar to a finite automaton without state transitions
  • Implications:
    - Cannot capture temporal dependencies
    - Treats each sentence as a bag-of-words (order-independent)
    - Suitable for tasks where word order is less critical

 **SEQUENCE PROCESSING**
  • Processing Model: PARALLEL (all features processed simultaneously)
  • Comparison to Turing Machine:
    - Turing Machine processes symbols SEQUENTIALLY on tape
    - Dense NN processes entire TF-IDF vector at once
    - No concept of 'reading head' moving across input
  • Implications:
    - Fast inference (no sequential bottleneck)
    - Cannot model long-range dependencies
    - Word order information is lost

  **COMPUTABILITY & EXPRESSIVENESS**
  • Computational Power:
    - Dense NNs are UNIVERSAL FUNCTION APPROXIMATORS
    - Can approximate any continuous function (Universal Approximation Theorem)
    - However, NOT Turing-complete (cannot simulate arbitrary computation)
  • Limitations:
    - Fixed input size (vocabulary dimension)
    - Cannot handle variable-length sequences naturally
    - No internal state or memory mechanism
  • Comparison to Turing Machine:
    - Turing Machine: Can compute any computable function
    - Dense NN: Limited to function approximation over fixed inputs

 **CONNECTION TO FORMAL LANGUAGE THEORY**
  • Language Recognition Capability:
    - Can recognize REGULAR LANGUAGES (like finite automata)
    - Cannot recognize CONTEXT-FREE or CONTEXT-SENSITIVE languages
    - Sentiment classification is a REGULAR task (word presence/absence)
  • Chomsky Hierarchy Position:
    - Level 3: Regular Languages 
    - Level 2: Context-Free Languages ❌
    - Level 1: Context-Sensitive Languages ❌
    - Level 0: Recursively Enumerable Languages ❌
